For example, suppose we want to create a pipeline project of type `detection_to_classification`, with a label 'animal' for the detection task and labels 'dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'cow' for the classification task. In that case we would pass `labels=[['animal'], ['dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'cow']]`. The first entry in the labels-list corresponds to the labels for the first task, the second entry to those for the second task in the pipeline and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case more complicated relationships between labels are required, we can specify the labels as dictionaries with certain properties instead of simple strings containing only their names. For example, to create a single task hierarchical classification project to classify 'animals' and 'vehicles' into subcategories, we could pass the following: \n",
    "```json\n",
