    "# Asynchronous inference\n",
    "In this notebook, we will configure a model deployment for asynchronous inference.\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you are familiar with model deployments for local inference (if not, please have a look at [notebook 008](008_deploy_project.ipynb) first). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronous vs Asynchronous inference\n",
    "First things first, what is asynchronous inference and why bother to use it? Up to now, we've been strictly using *synchronous* code to run local inference for our Geti models. This means that whenever we make an infer request to our model (using `deployment.infer()`), the code execution blocks and waits for the model to process the image that is being inferred. Since this is a compute-intensive operation, the CPU (or whatever device we use for inference) will be fully occupied at this time to perform the required calculations to compute the model activations for the image that we feed it. So far, so good. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, things may be different if you are running your inference code on a machine with multiple CPU cores. In that case, the synchronous call to `deployment.infer()` will fully occupy one of the cores, but leave the others running idle. The reason is that we can't efficiently share memory between processes running on different cores (this introduces overhead), so the computations for a single image to be inferred cannot simply be distributed across all CPU cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you only care about *latency*, meaning you want to get a result for your single image as quickly as possible, then this is not an issue. However, if *throughput* is an issue (for example for video processing), we may be able to improve the situation by using parallel processing. Instead of blocking execution for each infer request and waiting for it to complete, we can already send the *next* frame to another CPU core that would otherwise by sitting idle. This puts both cores to work at the same time, thereby increasing the rate at which the frames can be processed. This is exactly what we refer to as *asynchronous inference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily OpenVINO takes care of the parallelization and optimization of this process for us, we just have to set up our code for running local model inference a bit differently.\n",

    "## Step 2: Prepare the deployment for asynchronous inference\n",
    "To use the deployment in asynchronous mode, there are two main things to consider:\n",
    "1. Upon loading the inference models, we need to specify the size of the `infer queue` for the model. The infer queue is essentially a space of shared memory in which infer requests are stored. A request will be in the queue until one of the machine's cores is ready to process it. A larger queue means that requests may be picked up more rapidly, but will also consume more of the available system memory. Usually, setting the queue size to be roughly equal to the number of CPU cores on your system is a good choice.\n",
    "2. Defining what should happen when an infer request has finished processing. This is done via a function referred to as a `callback`. The callback executes whenever an infer request is ready, and the results are available. In this notebook, we'll set up a callback to print the inference results to the screen and save our image (with prediction overlay) to a folder on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's load the inference models. We'll set the number of infer requests (the infer queue) to be equal to the number of cores on the system. This is done using the parameter `max_async_infer_requests`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can configure OpenVINO to load our model in such a way so that throughput is maximized. This can be specified in the `openvino_configuration` parameter. See how it's done in the cell below:"

For example, a filename, timestamp, index, etc. In this example we will simply use the image index. The callback should not return any value"

    "## Summary\n",
    "Using the asynchronous inference mode allows you to make more efficient use of the compute capacity you have in your system, by parallelizing infer requests. If throughput is important in your application, using the asynchronous mode is recommended because it can result in a significant increase in the number of frames that can be processed per second. Depending on hardware configuration, an increase of 2x or more in framerate compared to synchronous mode can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The asynchronous mode does require a bit more care to set up and use than the synchronous inference mode. In asynchronous mode, inference results are processed via a pre-defined `asynchronous_callback`, which implements the required post processing steps for each inferred frame or image. As soon as the inference for an image or frame completes, the callback is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key differences between asynchronous and synchronous inference is the following: *There is no guarantee that infer requests will be processed in the same order as in which they are submitted.* In synchronous mode this processing order is guaranteed, because we submit the frames for inference one by one, and only submit the next one as the previous one completes. However, in async mode multiple frames are submitted for inference (almost) at the same time, and processed in parallel. Inference for each frame may complete at any time, so the order of the inferred frames is likely to be mixed up. \n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications this may not be a problem: Suppose I want to get the inference results for each image in a folder. Most likely I won't care about the order in which those images are processed, as long as I get the results for all of them in the end. However, for applications involving video processing this is a major issue because in video, the order of the frames obviously does matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geti-sdk provides a tool to avoid this problem, the `AsyncVideoProcessor`. It uses an ordered buffer to ensure that video frames are processed in the order in which they are passed. This allows for maximizing the frame rate for inferred video, while avoiding the problem of frames getting mixed up."
